43. A company is introducing a new feature for its application. The feature will refine the style of output messages. The company will fine-tune a large language model (LLM) on Amazon Bedrock to implement the feature. Which type of data does the company need to meet these requirements?
    - A. Samples of only input messages
    - B. Samples of only output messages
    - C. Samples of pairs of input and output messages
    - D. Separate samples of input and output messages

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: C

      Explanation: Fine-tuning a large language model to refine the style of output messages requires training data consisting of paired input and output messages. These pairs allow the model to learn the relationship between the input provided and the desired styled output, ensuring the fine-tuned model produces responses with the intended style.

44. A healthcare company is building an AI solution to predict patient readmission within 30 days of patient discharge. The company has trained a model on historical patient data including medical history, demographics, and treatment specifications, to provide readmission predictions in real time. Which task describes AI model inference in this scenario?
    - A. Gather historical patient readmission data.
    - B. Use appropriate metrics and assess model performance.
    - C. Use data to identify patient patterns and correlations.
    - D. Use a trained model to predict patient readmission.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: D

      Explanation: Model inference refers to the process of applying a trained model to new data—in this case, using the trained model to make real-time predictions about whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.

50. Which parameters are commonly used for controlling the output diversity in generative AI models? (Choose 2)
    - A. Top-k sampling
    - B. Model size
    - C. Top-p (nucleus) sampling
    - D. Training dataset size
    - E. Hardware configuration

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

      Correct answer: A, C

      Explanation:
      Top-k and Top-p sampling are key parameters for controlling output generation:
      - Top-k limits token selection to the k most likely next tokens
      - Top-p (nucleus) sampling selects from tokens that sum to probability p
      Both help balance between diversity and quality of generated content.

      **Task Reference**: These concepts relate to Task Statement 3.1 regarding inference parameters' effects on model responses.
