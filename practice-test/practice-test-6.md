45. What is the purpose of embeddings in machine learning?
    - A. To compress images
    - B. To represent data as dense numerical vectors
    - C. To encrypt sensitive information
    - D. To reduce training time

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

      Correct answer: B

      Explanation:
      Embeddings convert discrete data (like words, images, or categorical features) into dense numerical vectors that capture semantic relationships and can be processed by ML algorithms.

46. Which Amazon Bedrock features help with content filtering and safety? (Choose 2)
    - A. Guardrails for content filtering
    - B. Model customization options
    - C. Prompt management capabilities
    - D. Watermark detection for AI-generated content
    - E. Knowledge base integration

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

      Correct answer: A, D

      Explanation:
      Guardrails filter harmful, inappropriate, or unwanted content in both inputs and outputs, ensuring that AI-generated responses align with ethical and safety standards. Watermark detection helps identify AI-generated content, which is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability. By detecting watermarks, organizations can prevent misuse of AI-generated content, such as plagiarism or the spread of misinformation, thereby enhancing trust and safety in AI deployments.

47. What is the difference between discriminative and generative AI models?
    - A. Discriminative models are faster than generative models
    - B. Discriminative models classify/predict, generative models create new content
    - C. Discriminative models are more accurate than generative models
    - D. Discriminative models require more data than generative models

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

      Correct answer: B

      Explanation:
      Discriminative models learn to distinguish between different classes or predict outcomes (classification/regression), while generative models learn to create new content similar to their training data.

48. Which metrics are commonly used to evaluate generative AI model performance? (Choose 2)
    - A. BLEU score for translation quality
    - B. CPU utilization
    - C. ROUGE score for summarization quality
    - D. Network latency
    - E. Storage capacity

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

      Correct answer: A, C

      Explanation:
      BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score (A) is the standard metric for evaluating machine translation quality. It measures the precision of n-grams (word sequences) in machine translations compared to reference human translations, with scores ranging from 0 to 1 (higher is better). ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) (C) evaluates summarization quality by measuring the overlap between generated summaries and reference summaries, focusing on recall (how much of the reference appears in the generated summary). In AWS, you can implement these metrics in custom evaluation tests within Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation or SageMaker.

      Options B, D, and E are system performance metrics unrelated to output quality.

49. What is the primary purpose of Amazon Q for Business?
    - A. To train custom ML models
    - B. To provide AI-powered business intelligence and assistance
    - C. To store large datasets
    - D. To monitor infrastructure

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

      Correct answer: B

      Explanation:
      Amazon Q for Business is an enterprise-grade, generative AI-powered assistant specifically designed for business use. It integrates with enterprise systems, applications, and data repositories to provide contextual assistance to employees. Key capabilities include: answering questions about company data and policies, generating content like emails and documents based on internal knowledge, providing summaries of documents and meetings, troubleshooting issues and offering solutions, assisting with software development tasks, all while respecting company security policies and access controls. Unlike general AI assistants, Q for Business is specifically trained on your organization's internal information and maintains privacy and security requirements, making it different from both standard ML training tools (A) and basic data storage (C) or monitoring (D) solutions.
