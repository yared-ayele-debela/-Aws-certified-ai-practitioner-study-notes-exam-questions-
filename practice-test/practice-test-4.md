    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: AC

      Explanation: Generation of content embeddings New or updated documents can be converted to vector representations in periodic batches (e.g., hourly, nightly). Because a document’s embedding remains fixed until the document itself changes, this step does not have to run for every user query, making it ideal for offline processing. Creation of the search index After new embeddings are produced, the vector (or hybrid) index can be rebuilt or incrementally updated in batch mode. Index construction is computationally intensive but happens infrequently relative to user requests, so running it offline avoids adding latency to real-time interactions.

42. Which metric is used to evaluate the performance of foundation models (FMs) for text summarization tasks?
    - A. F1 score
    - B. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score
    - C. Accuracy
    - D. Mean squared error (MSE)

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: A

      Explanation: Text summarization quality is most commonly assessed using ROUGE metrics, which report recall, precision, and an F1-score that balances the two. The ROUGE-F1 (often simply called the F1 score in this context) measures how well the model’s summary overlaps with reference summaries, making it the standard choice for evaluating foundation models on summarization tasks.

43. What is the benefit of fine-tuning a foundation model (FM)?
    - A. Fine-tuning reduces the FM's size and complexity and enables slower inference.
    - B. Fine-tuning uses specific training data to retrain the FM from scratch to adapt to a specific use case.
    - C. Fine-tuning keeps the FM's knowledge up to date by pre-training the FM on more recent data.
    - D. Fine-tuning improves the performance of the FM on a specific task by further training the FM on new

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: D

      Explanation: By updating the model’s weights with task-relevant examples, fine-tuning sharpens its understanding of domain-specific language and objectives, yielding higher accuracy and relevance on that particular task.

44. A company wants to improve its chatbot's responses to match the company's desired tone. The company has 100 examples of high-quality conversations between customer service agents and customers. The company wants to use this data to incorporate company tone into the chatbot's responses.  Which solution meets these requirements?
    - A. Use Amazon Personalize to generate responses.
    - B. Create an Amazon SageMaker HyperPod pre-training job.
    - C. Host the model by using Amazon SageMaker. Use TensorRT for large language model (LLM)
    - D. Create an Amazon Bedrock fine-tuning job.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: D

      Explanation: Bedrock’s fine-tuning lets you adapt a foundation model on your own conversation examples—in this case, the 100 high-quality transcripts to instill your company’s tone directly into the model’s response generation.

45. An ecommerce company is using a chatbot to automate the customer order submission process. The chatbot is powered by AI and is available to customers directly from the company's website 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Which option is an AI system input vulnerability that the company needs to resolve before the chatbot is made available?
    - A. Data leakage
    - B. Prompt injection
    - C. Large language model (LLM) hallucinations
    - D. Concept drift

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: B

      Explanation: Prompt injection is an input-level attack where a user crafts malicious input to override or manipulate the chatbot’s instructions or behavior. Addressing this vulnerability by sanitizing and constraining user prompts ensures the chatbot won’t execute unintended or harmful instructions when it goes live.

46. A social media company wants to prevent users from posting discriminatory content on the company's application. The company wants to use Amazon Bedrock as part of the solution. How can the company use Amazon Bedrock to meet these requirements?
    - A. Give users the ability to interact based on user preferences.
    - B. Block interactions related to predefined topics.
    - C. Restrict user conversations to predefined topics.
    - D. Provide a variety of responses to select from for user engagement.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: B

      Explanation: Amazon Bedrock’s built-in content moderation lets you define categories or keywords (e.g., hate speech, discriminatory language) and automatically block or filter any user inputs or outputs that fall under those topics. By configuring Bedrock’s safety filters with your predefined “disallowed” categories, the application will prevent discriminatory content from ever being posted.

47. Which statements about model latent space are correct? (Choose 2)
    - A. It represents the model's internal understanding of relationships
    - B. It is only used for image processing
    - C. It enables semantic similarities between different inputs
    - D. It requires human supervision to maintain
    - E. It must be stored in a specific database type

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

      Correct answer: A, C

      Explanation:
      Model latent space:
      - Represents the model's internal understanding and organization of concepts
      - Enables computation of semantic similarities between different inputs
      - Facilitates transfer learning and generalization
      - Supports various types of data representations

      **Task Reference**: This concept is referenced in Task Statement 3.2 under concepts of prompt engineering and model architecture.
