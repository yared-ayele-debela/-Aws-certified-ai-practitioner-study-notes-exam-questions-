# Practice Test 1

1. A company makes forecasts each quarter to decide how to optimize operations to meet expected demand. The company uses ML models to make these forecasts.

What should the AI practitioner include in the report to meet the transparency and explainability requirements?
    - A. Code for model training
    - B. Partial dependence plots (PDPs)
    - C. Sample data for training
    - D. Model convergence tables

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: B

      Explanation: Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are a powerful tool for understanding and explaining how the features in a machine learning model impact predictions. They are often used to meet transparency and explainability requirements for stakeholders. Let's go over why this is the correct choice, along with why the other options are less suitable: Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) Purpose: PDPs show the relationship between a feature (or multiple features) and the model's predicted output, which helps to explain the effect of each feature on the model’s predictions. Explainability: By visualizing how each feature influences the prediction, stakeholders can better understand how the model works and why it makes certain predictions. This level of interpretability is essential for gaining trust from non-technical stakeholders. Transparency: PDPs improve transparency by providing an intuitive way to analyze and present the effects of individual features.

44. A company is developing a new model to predict the prices of specific items. The model performed well on the training dataset. When the company deployed the model to production, the model's performance decreased significantly. What should the company do to mitigate this problem?
    - A. Reduce the volume of data that is used in training.
    - B. Add hyperparameters to the model.
    - C. Increase the volume of data that is used in training.
    - D. Increase the model training time.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: C

      Explanation: Increasing the volume of data used in training helps the model generalize better to new, unseen data, reducing overfitting and improving performance in production. The other options either do not address the issue of model generalization or are unlikely to effectively solve the problem.

45. An ecommerce company wants to build a solution to determine customer sentiments based on written customer reviews of products. Which AWS services meet these requirements? (Choose 2)
    - A. Amazon Lex
    - B. Amazon Comprehend
    - C. Amazon Polly
    - D. Amazon Bedrock
    - E. Amazon Rekognition

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: B, D

      Explanation: Amazon Comprehend: This service is specifically designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis, making it ideal for analyzing customer reviews. Amazon Bedrock: Bedrock can be used to leverage foundation models, which can also be employed for sentiment analysis tasks. The other options are not suitable for sentiment analysis of written customer reviews.

46. A company wants to use large language models (LLMs) with Amazon Bedrock to develop a chat interface for the company's product manuals. The manuals are stored as PDF files.  Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
    - A. Use prompt engineering to add one PDF file as context to the user prompt when the prompt is submitted to Amazon Bedrock.
    - B. Use prompt engineering to add all the PDF files as context to the user prompt when the prompt is submitted to Amazon Bedrock.
    - C. Use all the PDF documents to fine-tune a model with Amazon Bedrock. Use the fine-tuned model to process user prompts.
    - D. Upload PDF documents to an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. Use the knowledge base to provide context when users submit prompts to Amazon Bedrock

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: D

      Explanation: Using an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base allows the model to efficiently access relevant information from the PDF manuals when needed, reducing the cost compared to continuously fine-tuning a model or providing all PDFs as context in each prompt. This approach ensures that only necessary context is provided, making it cost-effective.
