## Overview

- Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
- It addresses the common challenges of managing the entire ML process in one place and provisioning infrastructure.
- SageMaker provides an end-to-end ML service that includes
- **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather and prepare datasets for training
- **Model Building, Training, and Tuning**: Develop and optimize ML models
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy models to production
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track and monitor prediction performance

### Built-in ML Algorithms

- SageMaker offers a comprehensive set of built-in ML algorithms
- **Supervised Algorithms:**
  - Linear regression and classification
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification
- **Unsupervised Algorithms:**
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - reduces the number of features in a dataset
  - K-means clustering - finds groupings in data
  - Anomaly detection
- **Specialized Algorithms:**
  - Textual algorithms for NLP and summarization

  - Provides an endpoint for individual predictions
  - Uses EC2 instances under the hood
  - Best for: Low-latency, interactive applications
- **Serverless Inference:**
  - No charges during idle periods between traffic spikes
  - Trade-off: Must tolerate initial startup latency (cold starts)
  - Best for: Sporadic, unpredictable workloads
- **Asynchronous Inference:**
  - Supports large payloads up to 1 GB (stored in S3)
  - Supports long processing times (up to 1 hour)
  - Good for near-real-time latency requirements
  - Requests and responses stored in S3
  - Best for: Large payloads requiring extended processing
- **Batch Transform:**
  - Recommended for predictions on entire datasets
  - Requests and responses stored in S3 buckets
