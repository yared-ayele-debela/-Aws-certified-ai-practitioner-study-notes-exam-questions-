- **Data Privacy Guarantee**: None of your data is sent to model providers for training the original foundation models—all operations occur solely within your account
- The model copy can be customized to better suit specific needs without affecting the original foundation model

### How to choose a foundation model?

#### Key Selection Factors

The choice of foundation model depends on multiple factors:

- **Model Type & Performance**: Different models excel at different tasks
- **Capabilities**: What the model can and cannot do
- **Constraints & Compliance**: Business and regulatory requirements
- **Customization Options**: Ability to fine-tune with your own data
- **Model Size & Inference Capabilities**: How outputs are generated (affects speed and resource usage)
- **Licensing Agreements**: Commercial use restrictions or requirements
- **Context Window**: Maximum amount of data you can send to the model (important for large documents/codebases)
- **Latency**: Response speed and performance
- **Multimodal Support**: Can the model handle multiple input types (text, audio, video, images) and produce multiple output types?

#### Important Considerations

- **Trade-offs**: Smaller models are more cost-effective but have less knowledge and capability
- **Testing is Essential**: There is no definitive answer; you must test models with your specific inputs and use cases
- **Language Support**: Different models support different languages
- **Cost Accumulation**: AI usage costs can accumulate rapidly, so pricing is a key consideration

#### Model-Specific Details

##### Amazon Titan

- High-performing foundation model directly from AWS (important for AWS certification)
- Supports multimodal inputs (text, images)
- Customizable through fine-tuning with your own data
- Cost-effective option
- Best for: Content generation, text classification, educational use cases

##### Llama-2 (Meta)

- Good for large-scale tasks and dialogue
- More expensive than Amazon Titan but cheaper than Claude
- 4,000 token limit (moderate context window)
- Best for: Technical content generation, customer service applications

##### Claude (Anthropic)

- Excellent for analysis, forecasting, and detailed document comparison
- **Largest context window (200,000 tokens)** - can process entire books, large codebases
- Most expensive option
- Best for: Complex analysis tasks, research, large document processing

##### Stable Diffusion (Stability AI)

- Image generation only
- Charged per image generated
- Best for: Advertising, media creation, visual content generation

#### Selection Strategy

1. **Identify Your Requirements**: Determine if you need text, images, or multimodal capabilities
2. **Check Language & Context Needs**: Do you need 100+ language support or large context windows?
3. **Consider Use Cases**: Match model strengths to your specific applications
4. **Factor in Cost**: Balance capabilities with pricing for your projected usage
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate model performance with your actual inputs and expected outputs before committing to production

## Fine-Tuning a Model

- Adapt a copy of a foundation model by adding your own training data
- **How It Works**: Fine-tuning changes the underlying **weights** of the base foundation model to better suit your specific needs
- **Training Data Requirements**:
  - Must adhere to a **specific format** (depends on fine-tuning type)
  - Must be stored in **Amazon S3**
- **Output**: A fine-tuned version of the foundation model that incorporates your data

### Types of Fine-Tuning

#### 1. Instruction-Based Fine-Tuning

- Improve performance on domain-specific tasks using labeled examples

- **Data Format**:
  - Requires **labeled data** as prompt–response pairs
  - Each example includes a prompt and expected completion

**Example**:

```text
Prompt: what is aws?
Completion: AWS stands for Amazon Web Services — it’s Amazon’s cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of on-demand IT services over the internet.
```

- **Benefits**:
  - Shows the model **how you want it to answer** specific questions
  - Aligns **tone and structure** of responses
  - Teaches domain-specific communication patterns
  - Usually **cheaper** because computations are less intense and less data is required
  - **Use Case**: Teaching a model specific answering style for customer service or specialized tasks

#### 2. Continued Pre-training

- Make a foundation model an expert in a specific domain
- **Data Format**:
  - Requires **unlabeled data** only (no prompt–response pairs)
  - Dataset contains inputs only—the model learns from raw information
  - Can be large documents or entire knowledge bases
- **Example**:
  - Feed entire AWS documentation to a model
  - After training, the model becomes an AWS expert
- **Benefits**:
  - Model learns specialized knowledge in a specific field
  - Can incrementally add more domain-specific data over time
  - Adapts to evolving information in your domain
- **Use Cases**:
  - Financial documents with industry-specific terminology
  - Medical literature for healthcare applications
  - Company proprietary knowledge bases
- **Note**: Usually **more expensive** than instruction-based fine-tuning due to higher computational requirements

#### 3. Single-Turn and Multi-Turn Messaging

- Subsets of instruction-based fine-tuning focused on conversational behavior
- **Data Format**:
  - Each message has a **role** (system, user, or assistant) and **content** (text)
  - Optional **system role** provides context for the conversation

**Example Structure**:

```text
System: You are a helpful customer service assistant.
User: What are your support hours?
Assistant: We're available 24/7 to assist you.
User: How do I reset my password?
Assistant: You can reset your password by clicking "Forgot Password" on the login page.
```

### Transfer Learning

- Using a pre-trained model to adapt it to a new but related task
- **Key Concept**:
  - Foundation models already have base knowledge (recognize patterns, process language, etc.)
  - Transfer learning leverages this knowledge for specialized applications
  - **Fine-tuning is a specific type of transfer learning**
- **Examples**:
  - Image Classification: Pre-trained model knows edges/shapes → fine-tune to recognize specific image classes
  - NLP Tasks: Model understands language → transfer to domain-specific tasks

### Use Cases for Fine-Tuning

Common scenarios where fine-tuning is beneficial:

1. **Chatbot Personalization**
   - Create a chatbot with a particular persona, tone, or brand voice
   - Example: Customer service bot with friendly, empathetic tone

2. **Purpose-Specific Adaptation**
   - Adapt a model for specific business purposes
   - Examples: Customer assistance, advertisement creation, technical support

3. **Proprietary Data Integration**
   - Train with exclusive data the foundation model doesn't have access to
   - Examples: Historical emails, internal messages, customer service records, company procedures

4. **Targeted Tasks**
   - Specialized applications like text categorization or accuracy assessment
   - Domain-specific classification tasks

## Evaluating Foundation Models

- Sometimes you need to evaluate a model rigorously before selection or deployment
- Amazon Bedrock provides **Automatic Evaluation** feature to assess models for quality control
- Evaluation helps measure **accuracy, speed, efficiency, and scalability** of models
- Can detect **bias and potential discrimination** against groups of people
- Ensures model quality, fairness, and effectiveness in real-world applications
- We can have business metrics top evaluate a model on:
  - **Uses Satisfaction**: gather use feedback and asses their satisfaction with the model responses
  - **Average Revenue Per Use (ARPU)**: we can compute the average revenue per user attributed to the GenAI app (monitor ecommerce user base revenue)
  - **Cross-Domain Performance**: measure the model's ability to perform cross different domain tasks (example monitor multi-domain ecommerce platforms)
  - **Conversion Rate**: generate recommended desired outcomes such as purchases
  - **Efficiency**: evaluate the model's efficiency in computation, resource utilization

### Automatic Evaluation

- Uses **benchmark questions** and **benchmark answers** representing ideal responses
- The model to be evaluated generates answers to benchmark questions
- A **judge model** (another generative AI model) compares generated answers with benchmark answers
- The judge model assigns a **grading score** based on similarity and quality
- Built-in task types:
  - Text summarization
  - Question and answer
  - Text classification
  - Open-ended text generation
- **Prompt Datasets**
  - **Your own custom prompt datasets** (tailored to your specific needs)
  - **AWS built-in curated prompt datasets** (pre-validated collections)
- Scores are calculated automatically
- There are different ways to calculate this grading score suing various statistical methods (example BERTScore, F1 score)

### Human Evaluation

- Benchmark questions and answers are reviewed by **humans** (not automated)
- Evaluators compare benchmark answers to model-generated answers
- Humans judge correctness based on domain expertise and business criteria
- This work team can be employees of our company or subject-matter experts (SMEs)
- We define metrics and how to evaluate a model: thumbs up/down, ranking, etc.
- We can chose from built-in task types (same as with automatic evaluation) or add custom task types

## What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

- **Definition**: Allows a foundation model to reference data sources **outside of its training data** without requiring fine-tuning
- **Key Advantage**: Enables models to access **up-to-date and specific information dynamically**
- **Use Case**: Perfect for company-specific data or frequently updated information
- **Comparison to Fine-Tuning**: RAG doesn't require retraining; it retrieves data at query time
- This data source is usually stored in a **vector database**

### How RAG Works with Amazon Bedrock

1. **Data Source Input**
   - Your data is stored in external sources (e.g., Amazon S3, Confluence, SharePoint)
   - Example: Company documents, product information, customer records

2. **Knowledge Base Creation**
   - Amazon Bedrock automatically processes your data from the source
   - Data is converted into **vector embeddings** via a vector database
   - Creates a searchable index of your data

3. **User Query**
   - User asks: "Who is the product manager for Yared Debela?"
   - Foundation model may not have this company-specific information in its training data

4. **Retrieval Process**
   - A search is performed within the knowledge base
   - Relevant information is fetched from the vector database using similarity matching
   - Example results: Yared Debela's details, support contacts, **product manager: Yared Debela**, engineer: Yared Debela

5. **Augmented Prompt Creation**
   - Retrieved information is combined with the original user query
   - Augmented prompt now contains both the question and relevant context
   - This enriched prompt is sent to the foundation model

6. **Generation**
   - Foundation model generates a response based on the augmented prompt
   - Response: "Yared Debela is the product manager for Yared Debela."

  - Think and act autonomously without explicit programming for each task
- Define what actions agents can perform
  - Integrate with APIs, Lambda functions, databases, and external systems
  - Can exchange data or initiate actions automatically
  - Define expected inputs
- **Agent Responsibilities**:
  - Example: Access customer purchase history → Provide recommendations → Place new orders
  - Agent understands these responsibilities and acts accordingly
- **How Agents Work** (Chain of Thought Approach):
  1. Agent receives task and examines: prompt, conversation history, available actions, knowledge bases
  2. Sends request to Bedrock Foundation Model to generate action plan
  3. Model outputs step-by-step instructions
  4. Agent executes steps sequentially (calling APIs, searching knowledge bases)
  5. Results returned to Bedrock model for synthesis
  6. Final response generated and returned to user
