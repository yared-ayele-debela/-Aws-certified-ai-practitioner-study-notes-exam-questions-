## IAM - Identity and Access Management

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS resources.
- Allows you to manage:
  - **Users**: Individual identities who interact with AWS services.
  - **Groups**: Collection of IAM users with similar access permissions.
  - **Roles**: Set of permissions to be assumed by AWS services or applications.
- **IAM: Users & Groups**
- **Users**: Represent individual identities that interact with AWS services. Users have unique credentials (username, password, access keys).
- **Groups**: Logical grouping of users to simplify permission management.
  - Permissions assigned to a group are automatically inherited by its users.
- Flexibility in User Management in IAM, users do not have to belong to a group, and a user can belong to multiple groups.
- This allows user to manage access permissions in a granular and efficient manner.
- For example, a user could belong to both the “QAs" group and the “Developers” group, inheriting permissions from both.

![iam-policies-inheritance](../../images/iam-policies-inheritance.png)

### IAM: Permissions

- **Permissions** are defined using policies.
- Policies specify what actions are allowed or denied on specific resources.
- In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs.
needs
- Policies can be attached to:
  - **Users**
  - **Groups**
  - **Roles**

### IAM Policies Structure

- Policies are JSON documents that define permissions.
- Key elements of a policy:
  1. **Version**: Policy language version (e.g., `2012-10-17`).
  2. **Id**: Optional unique identifier for the policy.
  3. **Statement**: Contains one or more permissions (allow or deny).
  4. **Sid**: Optional unique identifier for the statement.
  5. **Effect**: Either `Allow` or `Deny`.
  6. **Principal**: Specifies the AWS account, user, or role that is allowed or denied access.
  7. **Action**: Specifies which AWS service actions are allowed or denied.
  8. **Resource**: Specifies the AWS resources to which the actions apply.
  9. **Condition**: Specifies the conditions under which the policy is applied.

#### Example IAM Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "Policy1234567890",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/example-user"
      },
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    }
  ]
}
```

### IAM Roles for Services

- IAM roles are used to grant permissions to AWS services to perform actions on behalf of users or applications.
- To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles
- **Example use cases for IAM roles:**
  1. An EC2 instance can assume a role to access S3 buckets without the need for storing long-term credentials.
  2. Lambda functions can use roles to interact with other AWS services without hardcoding access keys.

## Amazon S3 - Simple Storage Service

### S3 Use cases

- Backup and storage
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes & big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static website

### S3 Overview - Buckets

- **Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)**
- Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- **Naming convention**
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number
  - Must NOT start with the prefix xn--
  - Must NOT end with the suffix -s3alias

### S3 Overview - Objects

- Objects (files) have a Key
- The key is the FULL path:
  - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
- The key is composed of **prefix** + **object name**
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
- There’s no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/")
- Object values are the content of the body:
  - Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
  - If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

- Durability:
  - High durability (99.999999999%, 11 9’s) of objects across multiple AZ
  - If you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
  - Same for all storage classes
- Availability:
  - Measures how readily available a service is
  - Varies depending on storage class
  - Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year

## Amazon EC2

- **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a scalable compute service that allows users to rent virtual servers in the cloud.
- It provides flexibility to scale compute resources up or down based on demand, offering a cost-effective solution for applications with variable workloads.
- Key features include:
  - **On-Demand Instances**: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second, with no long-term commitments.
  - **Reserved Instances**: Make a one-time payment for a significant discount on instance usage over a one- or three-year term.
  - **Spot Instances**: Bid for unused EC2 capacity at a potentially lower price, allowing cost savings for flexible workloads.

### EC2 Sizing and Configuration Options

- EC2 allows for customized sizing and configurations, which include:
  - **Instance Type**: Selecting the appropriate type based on the application's performance requirements.
  - **Storage Options**: Using Amazon EBS for persistent block storage or instance store for temporary storage.
  - **Networking**: Configuring VPCs, subnets, and security groups to control access and manage traffic.
  - **Elastic Load Balancing**: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to enhance availability and fault tolerance.
  - **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusting the number of instances based on demand, ensuring the application has the necessary resources.
  - Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data
  - **Firewall rules**: security groups

### EC2 User Data

- **User data** is a powerful feature for automating the setup of EC2 instances.
- It can be specified at instance launch and is executed on the instance when it first boots.
- **bootstrapping** means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is **only run once** at the instance **first start**
- **Common use cases include**:
  - Installing software packages (e.g., `yum install httpd -y` for Apache).
  - Downloading configuration files or scripts from Amazon S3.
  - Configuring system settings and services (e.g., starting an application server).
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

## AWS Lambda

- Serverless compute service to run code without managing infrastructure.
- Executes code in response to events (e.g., API calls, file uploads).
- Scales automatically and you only pay for usage.

| **EC2**                                            | **Lambda**                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Virtual Servers in the Cloud                       | Virtual functions – no servers to manage! |
| Limited by RAM and CPU                             | Limited by time - short executions        |
| Continuously running                               | Run on-demand                             |
| Scaling means intervention to add / remove servers | Scaling is automated!                     |

### Benefits of AWS Lambda

- **No server management**: AWS handles the infrastructure.
- **Automatic scaling**: Scales based on event triggers.
- **Flexible scaling**: Runs from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
- **Event-driven architecture**: Ideal for apps that need to respond to events.
- Easy Pricing:
  - Pay per request and compute time
  - Free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time
- Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services
- Event-Driven: functions get invoked by AWS when needed
- Integrated with many programming languages
- Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
- Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM!)
- Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!

### AWS Lambda Language Support

- Node.js
- Python
- Ruby
- Java
- Go
- .NET Core
- custom runtime (via container images) (community supported, example Rust)
- Lambda Container Image
  - The container image must implement the Lambda Runtime API
  - ECS / Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker images

### AWS Lambda Pricing: Example

- Based on number of requests and execution time.
- You can find overall pricing information here: <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/>
- First **1 million requests/month** are free.
- After that, **$0.20 per million requests**.
- **Execution duration**: $0.00001667 for every GB-second used (first 400,000 GB-seconds free per month).
- - Pay per duration: (in increment of 1 ms)
  - 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month for FREE
  - == 400,000 seconds if function is 1GB RAM
  - == 3,200,000 seconds if function is 128 MB RAM
  - After that $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds
- It is usually **very cheap** to run AWS Lambda so it’s **very popular**

## AWS CloudTrail

- Tracks and logs API calls made in your AWS account for auditing and governance.
- Useful for security analysis, compliance, and operational troubleshooting.
- CloudTrail is enabled by default!
- Provides a history of events/API calls made within an AWS account
- It can put logs into CloudWatch Logs or S3
- A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region
- In case of a resource deletion, to investigate it (who did it), we have to look inside CloudTrail first
- The default UI only shows create, modify and delete events
- **CloudTrail Trail features:**
  - Logs API calls across AWS services, including CLI, SDK, and Management Console.
  - Tracks who made the call, when, and from where.
  - Ability to store these events in S3 for further analysis
  - It can be region specific or global
- CloudTrail logs are encrypted with SSE-S3 encryption by default when they are stored into S3. There is a possibility to use SSE-KMS encryption
- A CloudTrail log entry contains information about:
  - Who made the request
  - When was the request made and from where
  - What was requested
  - What was the response
- CloudTrail may have a 15 minutes delay to deliver log files into the S3 bucket

## AWS Artifact

## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- **VPC-Virtual Private Cloud**: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)
- Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)
- A **public subnet** is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
- A **private subnet** is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
- To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables.

### Internet Gateway (IGW)

- Connects a VPC to the internet.
- Allows instances in the VPC to directly communicate with the internet.
- Essential for a public subnet in a VPC to send/receive traffic to/from the internet.

### NAT Gateway

- Allows instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet.
- Prevents unsolicited inbound traffic from reaching those instances.
- Used for scenarios where instances need to download patches, updates, etc., but should not be directly accessed from the internet.
- Managed by AWS

### VPC Endpoints and PrivateLink

- AWS Services are by default accessed over the public internet Private subnet
- Applications deployed in Private Subnets in VPC may not have internet access
- **We want to use VPC endpoints**
  - VPC Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public network
  - Usually powered by AWS PrivateLink
  - This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
  - Example: your application deployed in a VPC can access Bedrock model privately
- **S3 Gateway Endpoint**
  - Access Amazon S3 privately
  - There’s also an S3 Interface Endpoint
  - Example: SageMaker notebooks can access S3 data privately

## AWS Services for Bedrock
