## Overview

- A fully managed, serverless natural language processing (NLP) service
- It accepts input documents which can come from a wide area of sources such as: social media, email, web pages, raw documents, transcripts, medical records (Comprehend Medical)
- Uses machine learning to find insights and relationships within text
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Extracts key phrases, entities (people, places, brands, events)
  - Analyzes sentiment (positive or negative)
  - Understands language and performs tokenization
  - Part-of-speech tagging
  - Organizes collections of text files by topics
  - Events detection (mainly about companies)
  - Identifies and redacts PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
  - Targeted sentiment analysis for specific entities
  - Custom classification and entity recognition
- We can train it on our own data
- **Use Cases**
  - **Customer Interaction Analysis**
    - Analyze emails and support tickets to identify factors leading to positive or negative experiences
    - Categorize customer feedback by sentiment and topics
    - Identify common complaint patterns
    - **Content Organization**
      - Group articles by topics that Comprehend automatically uncovers

## Why Use Amazon Comprehend?

- **Fully Managed**: No infrastructure to maintain
- **Serverless**: Scales automatically
- **Pre-trained Models**: Ready to use out-of-the-box
- **Customizable**: Train on your own data for specific use cases
- **Multiple Analysis Types**: Real-time and asynchronous processing

## Custom Classification

- We can organize documents into categories that we define
- Example: categorize customer emails so that we can provide guidance based on the type of the customer request
- Supports different types of documents (txt, PDF, Word, images)
- **Real-time analysis** on single documents on a synchronous way
- **Asynchronous analysis** on a batch of documents

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- NER – Extracts predefined, general-purpose entities like people, places, organizations, dates, and other standard categories, from text
- **Use Cases**
  - Identify key people in a document
  - Extract company names and locations
  - Find dates and times
  - Categorize events and activities

## Custom Entity Recognition

- We can analyze text for specific terms and noun-based phrases
- Can be used to extract terms like policy numbers or phrases that imply a customer escalation, or anything specific to our business
- We can train the model with custom data such as a list of entities and documents that contain them
- It can do real-time or async analysis

## Amazon Comprehend Medical
