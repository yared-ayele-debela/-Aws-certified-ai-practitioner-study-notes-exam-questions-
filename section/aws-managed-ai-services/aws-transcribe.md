## Improving Accuracy

- Custom Vocabulary (for words)
  - Helps Transcribe recognize **domain-specific or non-standard terms**
  - Useful for **technical words, acronyms, jargon**, etc.
  - Two types:
    - **Vocabulary Lists**: simple list of special words
    - **Vocabulary Tables**: advanced control using `SoundsLike`, `IPA` and `DisplayAs`
  - Example:
    - Without custom vocabulary: "AWS Microservices" → "USA my crow services"
    - With custom vocabulary: "AWS Microservices" → correct transcription
- Custom Language Models (for context)
  - Provide **context**, not new words
  - Train the Transcribe model using **your own domain-specific text data**
  - Helps Transcribe choose the correct meaning based on industry or use case
  - Example:
    - "microservice":
      - Bird context → "my crow service"
      - IT context → "microservice"
- **Using both custom vocabularies and custom language models provides the highest transcription accuracy**
